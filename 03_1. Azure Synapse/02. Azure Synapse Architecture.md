# Azure Synapse Architecture

**Core Components of Azure Synapse Analytics**
   
1. **Serverless SQL Pools**:
- On-demand querying without needing to provision resources.
- Useful for running ad-hoc queries over data stored in Azure Data Lake or Blob Storage.
- Pay only for the queries you run.

2. **Dedicated SQL Pools**:  
- Mapped to large-scale, performance-optimized relational data warehouses.
- Use for heavy-duty, high-performance transactional and analytical workloads.
- Provides SQL-based querying for complex analytics.



3. **Spark Pools**:  
- Apache Spark clusters to perform distributed data processing.
- Supports multiple languages like Python, Scala, and R for big data analytics and machine learning.

4. **Azure Data Lake**:  
- Storage platform for handling large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
- Highly scalable and optimized for analytics workloads.

5. **Power BI**:  
- Visualization tool that can be seamlessly integrated with Azure Synapse for real-time reporting and dashboards.
