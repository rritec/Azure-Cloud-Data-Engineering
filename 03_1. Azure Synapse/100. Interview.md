# Azure Synapse Analytics Interview Questions and Answers

## **ðŸ”¹ Basic Level**

### **1. What is Azure Synapse Analytics?**
**Answer:**  
Azure Synapse Analytics is a cloud-based **analytics service** that integrates **big data and data warehousing**. It provides a **unified experience** for:
- **SQL-based querying** (serverless & dedicated pools)
- **Spark-based big data processing**
- **Data integration** (via Synapse Pipelines)
- **Power BI integration** for visualization  

---

### **2. What are the key components of Azure Synapse?**
**Answer:**  
Azure Synapse has the following components:
- **Dedicated SQL Pool** â€“ Provisioned, high-performance data warehousing.
- **Serverless SQL Pool** â€“ On-demand querying without infrastructure setup.
- **Apache Spark Pool** â€“ Big data processing using Spark.
- **Data Integration** â€“ Synapse Pipelines for ETL (similar to ADF).
- **Synapse Studio** â€“ A unified workspace for development and monitoring.

### **3. Difference between Dedicated SQL Pool and Serverless SQL Pool?**
| Feature | Dedicated SQL Pool | Serverless SQL Pool |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Compute Type** | Pre-provisioned | On-demand |
| **Best For** | Large-scale data warehousing | Ad-hoc querying of files in Data Lake |
| **Cost** | Charged per provisioned DWU | Pay-per-query (per TB scanned) |
| **Use Case** | Structured, high-performance workloads | Exploratory queries on unstructured data |

---

### **4. How does Azure Synapse integrate with Azure Data Lake?**
**Answer:**  
- Serverless SQL Pool and Spark Pools **query data directly** from Azure Data Lake.
- **Synapse Link** provides near real-time analytics from Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Pipelines** allow movement of data from **Data Lake to Synapse tables**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level**

### **5. What is a Data Warehouse Unit (DWU) in Azure Synapse?**
**Answer:**  
- **DWU (Data Warehouse Unit)** is a **measure of compute power** in Azure Synapse.
- It represents **CPU, memory, and I/O** resources allocated to the SQL Pool.
- Higher DWUs = **faster performance** but **higher cost**.

| DWU Level | Performance | Cost |
|-----------|------------|------|
| **DW100** | Low | Low |
| **DW500** | Medium | Medium |
| **DW3000** | High | High |

---

### **6. What are Table Distribution Methods in Synapse?**
**Answer:**  
Azure Synapse **distributes** data across nodes for performance. Three distribution types:
1. **Hash Distribution** â€“ Distributes data based on a selected column (best for large fact tables).
2. **Round Robin Distribution** â€“ Evenly distributes rows across nodes (good for staging tables).
3. **Replicated Tables** â€“ Stores a full copy on each node (best for small dimension tables).

---

### **7. What are the different types of indexing in Synapse SQL Pool?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Clustered Columnstore Index (default)** â†’ Best for **analytical workloads**.
2. **Heap Tables (No Indexing)** â†’ Faster for **staging and temporary tables**.
3. **Clustered Index** â†’ Best for **OLTP-style workloads** (not common in Synapse).
4. **Non-Clustered Index** â†’ Improves performance on **specific queries**.

---

### **8. How do you optimize performance in Azure Synapse?**
**Answer:**  
âœ… **Use appropriate table distribution** (Hash for large tables, Replicated for small tables).  
âœ… **Partition large tables** for better query performance.  
âœ… **Use Materialized Views** to cache aggregated results.  
âœ… **Scale DWUs up/down based on demand** to balance cost and performance.  
âœ… **Use Result Set Caching** to improve repeated query performance.

## **ðŸ”¹ Advanced Level**

### **9. How does PolyBase work in Azure Synapse?**
**Answer:**  
PolyBase allows Synapse to query **external data sources (Data Lake, Blob, SQL Server, Cosmos DB, etc.)** without loading data into Synapse.

Example:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ExternalData
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'https://datalake.blob.core.windows.net/container/file.parquet',
    DATA_SOURCE = ExternalDataSource,
    FILE_FORMAT = ParquetFormat
)
AS SELECT * FROM ExternalData;
```

---

### **10. What is a Materialized View in Synapse, and how does it help?**
**Answer:**  
- A **Materialized View** stores precomputed results to **improve performance**.
- Reduces query execution time by **caching aggregated data**.

Example:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW SalesSummary
AS
SELECT StoreID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM SalesTable
GROUP BY StoreID;
```

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Scenario-Based Questions**

### **11. Scenario: Your Synapse query is slow. How do you troubleshoot?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Check Data Distribution** â†’ Use `DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED` to find skewed data.
2. **Check Query Execution Plan** â†’ Identify expensive operations.
3. **Use `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests`** â†’ Find long-running queries.
4. **Increase DWUs** â†’ Scale up compute if needed.
5. **Optimize Joins** â†’ Use **broadcast joins** for small tables and **hash joins** for large tables.
6. **Enable Result Set Caching** â†’ Reduce repeated query execution time.

---

### **12. Scenario: You need to load terabytes of data quickly into Synapse. Whatâ€™s the best approach?**
**Answer:**  
1. **Use COPY instead of INSERT**  
   ```sql
   COPY INTO sales_table
   FROM 'https://datalake.blob.core.windows.net/container/sales.parquet'
   WITH (FILE_FORMAT = 'ParquetFormat');
   ```
2. **Use PolyBase for external querying instead of ETL**  
3. **Increase Write Performance**:
   - Use **Heap Tables** for faster bulk inserts.
   - Use **Round Robin Distribution** for staging tables.
   - Scale **DWUs up during load**, then scale down.

- **Be prepared to optimize table distributions (Hash, Round Robin, Replicated).**
- **Know how to troubleshoot slow queries using DMV tables.**
- **Be familiar with PolyBase and Serverless SQL Pool for querying external data.**
